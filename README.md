NOTES
- Our submission includes a standalone website that is optimized for Google chrome

- We have hard-coded a user profile to show the features of the website,for the purpose of this submission:
  the onboarding flow would need to you to fill out fields but not validate their values( Fill the fields 
  with any values).All values would lead to the same single-user interface

- In the main part of the website : We used javaScript and HTML referencing to link pages



SOME INSTRUCTIONS
- To start click on index.html enclosed in this folder and start using the app. You can login using any credentials as it's not validated. 
  You can also create a new account, or "reset your password"

- If you would like to go past the onboarding, you can add the /homepage.html to your browser in lieu of the '/PageYoureOn.html' part in the link path
