- Our submission includes a standalone website that is optimized for Google chrome
- We have hard-coded a user profile to show the features of the website,for the purpose of this submission:
  the onboarding flow would need to you to fill out fields but not validate their values( Fill the fields 
  with any values).All values would leadto the same single-user interface
- In the main part of the website : We used javaScript and HTML referencing to link pages
